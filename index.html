       <h2> Harrison Siegel: KYTC Department of Highways </h2>
       <p> This webpage is for my Team Kentucky Internship Program (TKIP). I had the opportunity to work for the 
        transportation Cabinet in the state highway engineer office the summer of 2025. This experience has provided great new skill sets,
        field practice, and more opportunity to serve the commonwealth.

            Wrong Way Driving Project
        </h3>
        <p>
            The wrong way driving project is an example of a project I got to work on.
            The goal of this project is to prevent wrong way drivers on highway ramps. Methods
            used include detection cameras, signage, and illuminated warnings. I had the opportunity
            to examine ramp and sign design, attend planning meetings, and visit sites included
            in the project. The images posted are examples of a wrong way driving prevention sign
            and an example ramp design on New Circle Road in Lexington. By the time my internship
            is done the project will be nearly complete, only estimations and design conformations
            will remain. Long term, the goal is to implement these measures across the entire state.

            SASHTO confrence
        </h3>
        <p>
            Another part of my internship was working on the transportation schedules of the upcoming
             Southeastern Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (SASHTO) confrence
             being held in Lexington this August. For the confrence I had to help prepare a 
             detailed schedule of all the transportation from hotels, events, board meetings,
             and more.

            Cumberland Gap Tunnel
        </h3>
        <p>
            One of the sites I got to visit was the Cumberland Gap Tunnel. Located in the 
            Cumberland Gap National Historic Park, this tunnel provides 4 lane routes of U.S. 
            route 25 to Kentucky, Tennessee, and Virginia. This is one of two mountain tunnels in the U.S. 
            that crosses state lines. While at the site, I had the opportunity to take a tour of the facility.
            This tunnel has in-depth saftey measures with EMTs on staff along with a firefighting team.
            The tunnel also boasts chemical drainage systems, 2 backup power systems, and firehoses
            every 150 feet inside the tunnel. Another main feature of the tunnel is the chemical 
            truck transport. The tunnel is designed to escort chemical cargo with the upmost safety.
            All in all, this visit was very educational, and the tour provided by John Prater was excellent.

            TSMO Training
        </h3>
        <p>
            Another opportunity I had was attending a Transportation Systems Management and Operations (TSMO) training session. This session
            was attended by a plethora of different people with different backgrounds. The session consisted of different speakers and a presentation. There
            were also breakout rooms where small groups worked within the TSMO toolbox to solve real-world issues. The main goal of TSMO is to
            "Promote the safe mobility of all people by compiling a toolbox of strategies". These strategies include safety, information, equity,
            reliability, mobility/access, and environmental impact. The goal of TSMO systems are to help everyone on roads whether driving, biking
            or walking. TSMO separates implementation into 4 strategies of management: time, space, events, and information. The diagram
            shows implementation solutions for each type of management and how one solution can fit multiple strategies. One example that stood
            out to me was highway slowdowns in construction zones. When traffic slows due to an event, such as roadwork, sudden stops on an interstate or highway
            can be dangerous for drivers and workers. One solution to manage events and information can be using a portable queue warning alert system (PQWAS).
            This program creates signs before and along worksites providing drivers with warning about slowed or stopped traffic ahead. Radars are used 
            along with state fleet vehicles to determine speeds, this data is sent to operators to then change the boards alerting drivers. The TSMO 
            toolbox is filled with extraordinary data driven tools to issues faced all over Kentucky.

            KTC Board Meeting
        </h3>
        <p>
            The Kentucky Transportation Center (KTC) has been established for over 80 years. Their goal is to focus on "delivering practical solutions to critical transportation problems, 
            stellar technology transfer, and unparalleled customer service". KTC has partnered with several government agencies and universities
            in the state. I had the opportunity to attend one of their yearly board meetings
            at the University of Kentucky. Speakers from various backgrounds and departments within KTC spoke on research projects, highlighted members,
            and spoke about short-term plans for the agency. An important part about KTC to me is the student outreach. KTC works closely with UKY, my undergrad.
            I recall many different agencies speaking in my classes, and how beneficial they were to me. KTC generally reaches out to the engineering school,
            I offered my thoughts as a recent policy school graduate. KTC never reached out in my classes, and I feel it could be mutually beneficial as many
            of my peers are now government employees in various departments. Being able to talk to the board members and other staff offered unique insight
            on one of many agencies connected to the transportation Cabinet.

    <h1 id="Summary">Internship Summary</h1>
    <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>Throughout my internship, I had the opportunity to work on several different programs and collaborate with multiple agencies
            within the Transportation Cabinet. What challenged me the most was stepping into a project or
            program that was already in progress. Getting involved in an ongoing project required me to catch up on many key 
            concepts. Moreover, I had to gain all the background knowledge quickly to be engaged in the project. For example, the WWD 
            project required me to look at previous design plans and understand ITS systems. Without this previous knowledge I would not
            be able to keep up with the projects future developments. My solution was to get all the previous documentation archived so I could refer to it
            whenever I need to. Moreover I kept important documents on hand or saved to a personal file. This helped me quickly access
            the background information whenever it was necessary.
        </p>
    <h2>New Skills</h2>
        <p>My time at the Transportation Cabinet has provided me with real-world skills I will carry for the rest of my career. The first skill I developed was proper 
            engagement in professional settings. Sitting in on meetings for projects already in progress required me to stay 
            highly attentive in order to catch up to my peers. I took handwritten notes and saved questions for after 
            the meetings to remain focused and engaged throughout. Another skill I honed was diagram reading. 
            For the WWD project I examined over 40 design diagrams. Each sheet had in-depth details highlighting
            the plans for the given area. After reading all of these designs I learned how to identify key details and determine important factors.
            Overall, I gained new skills while also refining existing ones during my time at the Transportation Cabinet.
        </p>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>After finishing my internship, with the Transportation Cabinet I now have a clearer idea of what my future work life may look like. This fall, 
            I will be attending graduate school for city and regional planning at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I want to 
            focus on transportation and land management. Working at the Cabinet this summer has given me valuable, real-world 
            experience in my future field I have had the opportunity to work with public-sector agencies as well as private organizations under contract 
            with the Cabinet. I have met dozens of professionals across various departments who offered valuable guidance and career advice. The projects I have worked on provide me with
            critical experience for my future job applications. This internship has provided me exactly what I needed to work towards my future career.
            I strongly encourage anyone to apply for this program, it has been an outstanding experience.
