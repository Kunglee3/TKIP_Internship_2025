            Wrong Way Driving Project
        </h3>
        <p>
            The wrong way driving project is an example of a project I got to work on.
            The goal of this project is to prevent wrong way drivers on highway ramps. Methods
            used include detection cameras, signage, and illumanated warnings. I had the oppertunity
            to examine ramp and sign design, attend planning meetings, and visit sites included
            in the project. The images posted are examples of a wrong way driving prevention sign
            and an example ramp design on New Circle Road in Lexington. By the time my internship
            is done the project will be nearly complete, onlt estimations and desin conformations
            will remian. Long term, the goal is to implement these measures across the entire state.

            SASHTO Confrence
        </h3>
        <p>
            Another part of my internship was working on the transportation schedules of the upcoming
             Southeastern Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (SASHTO) Confrence
             being held in Lexington this August. For the confrence I had to help prepare a 
             detailed schedule of all the transporation from hotels, events, board meetings,
             and more.

            Cumberland Gap Tunnel
        </h3>
        <p>
            One of the sites I got to visit was the Cumberland Gap Tunnel. Located in the 
            Cumberland Gap National Historic Park, this tunnel provides 4 lane routes of U.S. 
            route 25 to Kentucky, Tennessee, and Virginia. This is one of two mountain tunnels in the U.S. 
            that crosses state lines. While at the site, I had the oppertunity to take a tour of the facility.
            This tunnel has in depth saftey measures with EMTs on staff along with a firefighting team.
            The tunnel also boasts chemical drainage systems, 2 backup power systems, and firehoses
            every 150 feet inside the tunnel. Another main feature of the tunnel is the chemical 
            truck transport. The tunnel is designed to escort chemical cargo with the upmost saftey.
            All in all this visit was very educational and the tour provided by John Prater was excellent.
